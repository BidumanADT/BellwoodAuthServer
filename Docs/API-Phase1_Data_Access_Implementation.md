# Phase 1: User Data Access Enforcement - Implementation Summary

**Status:** ? **IMPLEMENTED**  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Branch:** `feature/user-data-restriction`

---

## ?? Overview

Phase 1 implements per-user data isolation and basic access filtering for the Bellwood AdminAPI. This phase focuses on:

1. **Ownership tracking** via `CreatedByUserId` field on records
2. **Audit fields** for tracking modifications
3. **Role-based filtering** on list endpoints
4. **Ownership verification** on detail and mutation endpoints

---

## ?? Files Modified

### Models

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `Models/BookingRecord.cs` | Added `CreatedByUserId`, `ModifiedByUserId`, `ModifiedOnUtc` |
| `Models/QuoteRecord.cs` | Added `CreatedByUserId`, `ModifiedByUserId`, `ModifiedOnUtc` |

### Services

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `Services/UserAuthorizationHelper.cs` | **NEW** - Helper methods for authorization checks |
| `Services/IBookingRepository.cs` | Added `UpdateStatusAsync` overload with audit tracking |
| `Services/FileBookingRepository.cs` | Implemented audit-aware `UpdateStatusAsync` |

### API

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `Program.cs` | Updated endpoints with ownership capture and verification |

---

## ?? Authorization Logic

### Helper Methods (`UserAuthorizationHelper.cs`)

```csharp
// Get user ID from JWT claims
GetUserId(ClaimsPrincipal user) ? string?

// Role checks
IsStaffOrAdmin(user) ? bool  // admin or dispatcher
IsAdmin(user) ? bool
IsDriver(user) ? bool
IsBooker(user) ? bool

// Ownership checks
CanAccessRecord(user, createdByUserId) ? bool
CanDriverAccessBooking(user, assignedDriverUid) ? bool
CanAccessBooking(user, createdByUserId, assignedDriverUid) ? bool
```

### Access Rules

| Role | List Access | Detail Access | Cancel Access |
|------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Admin** | All records | All records | All bookings |
| **Dispatcher** | All records | All records | All bookings |
| **Driver** | Assigned only | Assigned only | ? (use status) |
| **Booker** | Own only | Own only | Own only |

---

## ?? Endpoint Changes

### Quote Endpoints

#### `POST /quotes` - Submit Quote
- ? Captures `CreatedByUserId` from JWT `uid` claim
- ? Logs creation with user ID

#### `GET /quotes/list` - List Quotes
- ? Staff sees all quotes
- ? Bookers see only quotes they created
- ? Legacy records (null owner) hidden from non-staff

#### `GET /quotes/{id}` - Get Quote Detail
- ? Verifies ownership before returning
- ? Returns 403 if user doesn't have access

### Booking Endpoints

#### `POST /bookings` - Submit Booking
- ? Captures `CreatedByUserId` from JWT `uid` claim
- ? Logs creation with user ID

#### `GET /bookings/list` - List Bookings
- ? Staff sees all bookings
- ? Drivers see only assigned bookings
- ? Bookers see only bookings they created
- ? Legacy records (null owner) hidden from non-staff

#### `GET /bookings/{id}` - Get Booking Detail
- ? Staff: full access
- ? Drivers: only if assigned
- ? Bookers: only if created
- ? Returns 403 if user doesn't have access

#### `POST /bookings/{id}/cancel` - Cancel Booking
- ? Verifies ownership before allowing cancellation
- ? Records `ModifiedByUserId` and `ModifiedOnUtc` in audit trail
- ? Logs cancellation with acting user ID
- ? Returns 403 if user doesn't have permission

## ??? Data Schema Changes

### BookingRecord

```csharp
public sealed class BookingRecord
{
    // ... existing fields ...
    
    // NEW: Ownership & Audit Fields (Phase 1)
    public string? CreatedByUserId { get; set; }    // Who created this record
    public string? ModifiedByUserId { get; set; }   // Who last modified this record
    public DateTime? ModifiedOnUtc { get; set; }    // When was it last modified
}
```

### QuoteRecord

```csharp
public sealed class QuoteRecord
{
    // ... existing fields ...
    
    // NEW: Ownership & Audit Fields (Phase 1)
    public string? CreatedByUserId { get; set; }    // Who created this record
    public string? ModifiedByUserId { get; set; }   // Who last modified this record
    public DateTime? ModifiedOnUtc { get; set; }    // When was it last modified
}
```

---

## ?? Backward Compatibility

### Existing Data

- All new fields are **nullable** (`string?`, `DateTime?`)
- Existing JSON data will deserialize without errors
- Legacy records with `null` ownership are treated as admin-only

### Existing Endpoints

- Response formats unchanged
- Existing authenticated clients continue to work
- Staff users see no difference in behavior

### Driver Endpoints

- `/driver/rides/today` - Unchanged (already filters by `AssignedDriverUid`)
- `/driver/rides/{id}` - Unchanged (already validates ownership)
- `/driver/rides/{id}/status` - Unchanged (already validates ownership)

---

## ?? Testing Scenarios

### Quote Access Tests

| Scenario | Expected |
|----------|----------|
| Admin lists quotes | All quotes returned |
| Booker lists quotes | Only their quotes |
| Booker gets own quote | Success |
| Booker gets other's quote | 403 Forbidden |

### Booking Access Tests

| Scenario | Expected |
|----------|----------|
| Admin lists bookings | All bookings returned |
| Driver lists bookings | Only assigned bookings |
| Booker lists bookings | Only their bookings |
| Booker gets own booking | Success |
| Booker gets other's booking | 403 Forbidden |
| Driver gets assigned booking | Success |
| Driver gets unassigned booking | 403 Forbidden |

### Cancel Tests

| Scenario | Expected |
|----------|----------|
| Admin cancels any booking | Success |
| Booker cancels own booking | Success |
| Booker cancels other's booking | 403 Forbidden |
| Driver cancels booking | 403 Forbidden |

---

## ?? JWT Claims Used

| Claim | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `uid` | User ID for ownership tracking (primary) |
| `sub` | Username (fallback if `uid` missing) |
| `role` | Role-based access control (`admin`, `booker`, `driver`) |

---

## ?? Known Limitations (Phase 1)

1. **No dispatcher role yet** - `IsStaffOrAdmin()` prepares for it but role doesn't exist
2. **Legacy data** - Records without `CreatedByUserId` are admin-only
3. **No PassengerUserId** - Concierge-booked trips only visible to concierge, not passenger
4. **No field masking** - Dispatchers see all fields (Phase 2)

---

## ?? Phase 2 Preview

- Introduce `dispatcher` role in AuthServer
- Add admin-only policy enforcement on sensitive endpoints
- Implement field masking for dispatchers (hide billing info)
- Add role-based policies (`AdminOnly`, `StaffOnly`)
